# frank-kasper-and-z-clusters
Dense random packed (DRP) atomic structures that are Frank-Kasper polyhedra, Z-clusters, etc.


This repository is my collection of Frank-Kasper polyhedra and Z-clusters (see dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pmatsci.2010.12.002 Fig. 36 and relevant text).

The goal is to provide atomic models of small short-range order (SRO) clusters that are geometrically favorable.

In metallic glasses, the shape of the SRO clusters are constrained by their surrounding atoms. The SRO clusters may, therefore, not be at the global minimum of their geometrically favorable structure (assuming they want to be geometrically stable). Therefore not all structures contained here will be at the global minimum, and instead other locally stable structures may be present.

The LAMMPS scripts I used to generate these structures are provided. They use MD and conjugate gradient minimization schemes.
