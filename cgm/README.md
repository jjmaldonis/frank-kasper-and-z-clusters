This is my attempt to create FK polyhedra and z-clusters for CNs. Atomic ratios were taken from Miracle's paper (doi 10.1080/1478643031000098828, Table 1), which was used in E Ma and YQ's review paper linked in the main readme.

This CGM method worked "okay", but didn't give good structures for some coordination numbers. After talking with YQ, Jin Ding, and E Ma, I ran LJ MD simulations and extracted out the structures with the same VP index. Using that group of clusters, I ran PPM/motif extraction to get one structure, then I ran CGM on it (see, for example, folder 11 herein).
