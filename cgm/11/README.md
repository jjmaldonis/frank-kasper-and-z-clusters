This is my attempt at creating CN 11 Z-cluster(s)

The avg\_75.xyz/dat file is the atomic structure that I created using the PPM/motif extraction code (see one of my other repos) after running a LJ MD simulation (see `md` directory in this repo).

After plotting the energy of the CGM on this structure, there are two relevant structures; one is the final structure, and the other is the structure at ~ timestep 12 or 13.
